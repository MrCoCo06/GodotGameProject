# GodotGameProject

Game project using GODOT made by: 
* Jonathan

Welcome to my GodotGameProject!
This project was the beginning of my interaction with Python programming language in any scale. I bought a package from Zenva Academy, where the main objective was to create a simple game using the Godot game engine. This engine uses a GD script, which is based on Python. With that in mind, I took this oportunity to have a bit of fun adding new features on my own by looking at documentation on the internet. It was a fun project and i'm happy that I got the chance to create this little game. 

If you are interested on looking at the code, you can do so by looking at the "GD files" folder. 

NOTE: I'm not a game designer, on this proyect I tried my very best to organize the game files as I thought it would be best. The main objective of this little project was to understand the basic of Python (in this case is GD script which is mostly based on it) and how to tinker with it. With this in mind, I'll be moving from now on to create more applications rather than creating games.

As of AUG-29-2021: 
Added basic enemy combat, expanded level design, added finishing flag, comments were added to the code. The intention of this update is to have a playable demo with only one level. It is enough to show how the games run. More updates will be done in the future, but as for today, AUG-29-2021, and forward, I'll be making minor changes or adding new features slowly to solely focus on more advanced projects that I have in mind.
