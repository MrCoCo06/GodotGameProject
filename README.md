# GodotGameProject

Game project using GODOT made by: 
* Jonathan

Welcome to my GodotGameProject!
This project was the beginning of my interaction with Python programming language in any scale. I bought a package from Zenva Academy, where the main objective was to create a simple game using the Godot game engine. This engine uses a GD script, which is based on Python. With that in mind, I took this oportunity to have a bit of fun adding new features on my own by looking at documentation on the internet. It was a fun project and i'm happy that I got the chance to create this little game. 

As of AUG-29-2021:
Added basic enemy combat, expanded level design, added finishing flag, comments where added to the code. The intention of this update is to have a playable demo with only one level. It is enough to show how the games run. More update will be done in the future, but as for today, AUG-29-2021, and forward, I'll be making minor changes or adding new feature slowly to solely focus on more advanced projects that I have on mind.
